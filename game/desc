It's the first day of school, and as soon as you arrive, the students are all already hitting on each other. But things start to go awry when Sans and Betty are no longer together, leaving Sans open to both Jake F*cking Paul and Shane Dawson. Make your way through this brutally romantic adventure, meet some new friends (and familiar faces) along the way, and help them all with their love life. Oh... did we also mention you have to save the universe from an evil slimy demon who's trying to take control of it all? Yeah, there's that too.
