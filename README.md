<p>It's the first day of school and everything is not what it seems. While you continue to stir drama between yourself, Betty, Sans, and Norf, two new students (Shane Dawson and Jake F*cking Paul) arrive at your school. There's something different about them that you can't quite put your finger on, however.</p>
<p>As things get even weirder and romances begin to blossom, you run into some more new faces who also seem out of place. Together, all of you decide to figure out what's going on, while also potentially banging it out in the middle of your mission.</p>
<p>This game contains multiple endings, each of which are reached depending on the choices you make throughout the game</p>
